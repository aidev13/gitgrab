# GitGrab

## Objective: 
### This simple project was built to pull data from the GitHub API and use local JSON for login information and endpoints. I used it to pull data such as, 
* Avatar img
* GitHub about info
* Repo, Followers and Following count
* GitHub link

### This repo will start on a 404 page. Once you navigate to the login page, there are only 3 users — myself and two others who have played a large role in my learning journey.

### Here are the usernames (UN) and passwords (PW) for each:

> UN: Josh PW: pass <br>
> UN: Brad PW: pass <br>
> UN: David PW: pass

## Why?

### To practice working with:

* Arrays and their methods
* JSON
* `fetch()`
* APIs
* `async/await`
* and just for fun!

## This app is published on PlayCode.io and can be accessed at the following link:

### I used no JS frameworks, as this was built to strengthen my fundamental JavaScript skills.

However, I did use Bootstrap and utilized AI for the HTML structure — **not to be confused with "vibe coding"**, which I strongly discourage myself from doing. I use AI (ChatGPT as a tool to help debug and learn, not to code and pretend...) I created this project to somewhat mimic backend JS coding.

## Enjoy something simple - GitGrab.
